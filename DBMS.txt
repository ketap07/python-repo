DATASYSTEM IS DIVIDED INTO DATABASE AND DBMS 
AGAIN DATABASE IS DIVIDED INTO STRUCTURE AND UNSTRUCTURE 
DATABASE IS  COLLECTION OF REALATED DATA EXAMPLE STUDENT DATA WILL HAVE COURSE DATA, IT CANNOT HAVE OTHER DATA LIKE EMPLOYEE 
1) STRUCTURE DATABASE - THIS DATA HAS FORMAT OR  PATTEREN ( THE FORMAT THIS DATABASE IS TABLE )
THIS DATABASE CONSIST OF RDBMS ( MEANS THIS WILL SHOW RELATION WITH ANOTHER DATA IN THE FORM OF TABLE)
2) TO STORE AND ACESS THIS DATA WE NEED DBMS .
DBMS IS COLLECTION OF OPERATION LIKE INSERT , DELETE , UPDATE , IN SHORT IMPLEMENTATION OF RDBMS IS DONE WITH THE HELP OF DBMS 
3) FOR IMPLEMENTATION THERE ARE DIFFERENT SOFTWARE LIKE MYSQL, ORCALE , IDBM ,SQL SERVER
ADVANTAGES
4) DBMS SPEED THE SEARCH , MEMORY ALLOCTION IS EFFICENT
SECURITY, CONCURRENCY , REDUNDANCY IS GOOD THAN FILE SYSTEM.
CONCURRENCY - MEANS MULTPILE USER CAN ACESS THE DATA AT THE SAME TIME.
SECURITY- USER IS NOT DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO DBMS , 
ALL DATA IS NOT VISIBLE  TO THE USER THERE ARE SOME RESTRICTION ON THAT 
FOR EXAMPLE IF DATABASEADMISITATIOR WANT DEVELOPER  TO GO FOR SPECIFIY DATA ONLY  WHICH IS KNOW AS VIEW ,
 SO IT WILLHAVE ACCESS TO PARTICULAR DATA ONLY ,NOT WHOLE DATA , BECAUSE OF THESE SECURITY IS GOOD.
REDUNDANCY- THERE IS NO DUPLICATE DATA  PRESENT WITH THE HELP OF CONSTRAINTS LIKE NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY .
